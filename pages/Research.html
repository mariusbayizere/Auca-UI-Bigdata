        <h4>philosophy</h4>

        <p>The Office of Research and Publications, and English Language Centre subscribes to the philosophy that man was created in the image of God but as a result of willful disobedience, sin has marred his God given attributes and divine likeness. This philosophy recognizes that the objective of Education is also that of redemption which is “to restore in man the image of his maker and bring him back to the perfection in which he was created” (White, 1952. p. 11). Therefore the work of redemption is the work of Education, which involves the development of the whole person physically, mentally, spiritually and socially.</p>

Furthermore, one of the main criteria employed in ranking world class Universities is cutting edge research that has resulted in breakthrough findings and sustainable development. The goal is to develop AUCA as Centre of Excellence in research for development. This goal will be realized through the following:

Establishing a structured and coordinated approach to research.
Stimulating interest of faculty and students in research activities, organizing trainings, workshops, disseminating information on grants and advertising research opportunities and outputs.
Facilitating research collaborations at both local and international levels.
Showcasing research outcomes by organizing and participating in local and national research affairs.</p>
